# ✝️ Jesus Freaks

> A faith-based social media experience for believers to share Scripture, stories, and snapshots of God’s goodness. 🌿📸

## 🌄 Background

What started as a fleeting thought while scrolling through typical social media turned into a Spirit-led passion. The **Devotional Blog** was born from a desire to stay rooted in Christ while staying connected to friends—new and old. 

This platform is a place to uplift, reflect, and celebrate the presence of God in our everyday lives through shared devotionals, photos, and Scripture.

> “Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.” – *1 Thessalonians 5:11*

## 🙏 Why Jesus Freaks?

Because we need Christ-centered community in the digital world.

🛑 No distractions.  
🕊️ Just faith.  
💬 Just encouragement.  
📖 Just the Word.

This is a place to be vulnerable, to grow spiritually, and to keep the gospel flowing across generations—online and offline.
